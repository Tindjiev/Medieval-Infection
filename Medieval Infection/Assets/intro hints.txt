-From what you heard, combined with your experience, this what is known about the Plague:
   A infectant carries it for about ^&*1 to ^&*2 days.
   Then, they are judged by the Plague to die. If not, there's a chance they'll be freed. This will continue for each coming day after this.
   After recovery, at least ^&*3 days must pass for them to be able to get ill again.

-Trust:
   With your actions and their result, you'll have to gain the residents' trust.
   Failure to do so will result in them rallying against you and you'll be forced to leave. (at -100 Trust)
   

-Treatments:
   Purification with Holy Water
      This alone has no effect, but the residents won't be happy if an ailing dies non-purified.
      However, the village's trust will grow more if purified patients recover.

   Treacle
      A remedy that has proven to be effective.
      One must wait years for this medicament, so it should not be wasted as you have limited amount with you.

   Blood Letting
      Draining one's blood hasn't given the best results, but it has been observed that it accelerates the infection's outcome, whether that's death or recovery.
      Such dangerous process cannot be applied on children and the elderly.
      One can just cut an infectant's skin to drain blood; this is the safer option and speeds up the judgement by one day on average.
      Leeches can also be used; this is more dangerous, but the acceleration is two days and can only be done on fully developed people.
      The folk is impressed when the ill recovers using such method.
      It is better to use this on sick people you are certain they'll recover.

   Death
      Sometimes the best decision is to put the infectant out of their misery; that way the Plague will have one less servant to help it spread around.
      Obviously, the residents won't be too keen on such action.
