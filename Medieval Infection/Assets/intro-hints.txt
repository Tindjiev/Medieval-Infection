-From your experience and what you've heard these are the things you have deduced about the Plague:
   It stays on a person for about one to five days.
   Then, the patient is judged by it to die. If not, there's a chance they'll be freed. This will continue for each coming day after that.

-Trust:
   According to your actions and their result, you'll either earn the trust of the residents, or they'll rally against you. (At -100 Trust)


-Treatments:
   Purifying with Holy Water
      This alone has no effect in the results, but the residents will not be happy if a resident dies and it hadn't been applied on them.

   Treacle
      A medicine that has proven to be effective.
      One must wait years for it to be produced so your usage of it should be limited as you don't have any left overs.

   BloodLetting
      Draining one's blood hasn't given the best results, but it has been observed that it accelerates the end of the infection, whether that is death or recovery.
      One can just cut with a knife the skin of the patient, this is relatively safe and accelerates the judgement on an average of one day.
      One can also use leeches to drain the blood, this is more dangerous, but the judgement will be accelerated on average by two days.
      The normal folk is impressed when the patient recovers after such an operation.
      It cannot be applied on children and old folk and it is best to use this method on patients in good condition

   Death
      Sometimes the best course of action is to put the patient out of their misery and also that way the Plague will have one less servant to be spread easily.
